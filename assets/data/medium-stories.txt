Hi there! this is a story about a new app, API Explorer, built on top of Flutter and Firebase. You can grab the code from https://github.com/rotoxl/flutter_magic.

= Overview =
API Explorer's target is to provide a tool somewhere between low and highlevel to visualize the data in an API. 

Think about a data API that provides a few URLs to get a sample of raw data that interests you.
Eg:
    * https://www.theaudiodb.com, "TheAudioDB is a community run database of Music Artwork, Metadata, Charts, Events, Music Videos and File Hashes, with free access via our front-end Website or back-end JSON API". 
    * Info about an artist -> https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/search.php?s=the%20beatles
    * Albums by an artist -> https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/searchalbum.php?s=the%20beatles)

Well, API Explorer allows anyone to go from raw data to this:

The same idea is applicable to more APIs of different kind of information

Can you see the pattern? All the samples follow the same design!

Wait: but what if data doesn't follow this structure?
    Well, the template is flexible, did you notice that Mars' screenshot doesn't have a description? what about the tags? 
    Also, there are a few templates more, each one suitable for a different use case, and it's even possible to link several templates to one data API.

Enter the template model
    Right now API Explorers provides 4 basic templates for the listing and 4 templates for the detail window. Every template is just a starting point, they all contain several customizable features
        * detail window: suitable for... pretty much everything. Contains a hero section, a header section with poster, title, stats and chips, description, key/value listing, images widget, related widget...
        * compare: suitable for item compare screens
        * hero: large, background image, with a few texts
        * match: suitable for competitions, like a football league.

Listing model
    There are also, several models to list the items in the data API:
        * list
        * image grid (without name)
        * image grid with name
        * match
    <image>

What's next
    In future releases I plan to allow everyone to add new data APIs. You will also be able to test your own APIs. I also want to add new templates for new use cases. Time will tell.

===============================================
Under the hood
    It all starts with a public data API:
        https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-explorer-app/planets/planets.json
    
    API Explorer reads & parses it, obtaining a set of items

The series will contain the following articles
* Overview
    At first API Explorer only needs a data API EndPoint
* Lists and grids
* Templates ('detail', 'compare', 'hero', 'match')
* Advanced templating (hint:it's all json)
* My experience building it with Flutter
